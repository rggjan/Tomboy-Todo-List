\subsection{Earlier solutions}
\subsubsection{Tasks}
There is a project (realized as an Addin) for task management, called \textit{Tasks}, created by Boyd Timothy for quite some time. However, this was removed in Version 0.9.3 of Tomboy, because there were too many problems with the existing implementation\footnote{\url{http://lists.beatniksoftware.com/pipermail/tomboy-list-beatniksoftware.com/2008-January/000540.html}}, i.e. bugs and missing integration into Tomboy.

Timothy abandoned the code and created a new program called \textit{Tasque}\footnote{\url{http://live.gnome.org/Tasque}} with its main focus just on task management.

\subsubsection{TaskLists}
In 2009 a new Addin was initiated by Sandy Armstrong. This unfinished project, called \textit{TaskLists}\footnote{\url{http://gitorious.org/~sandy/tomboy/sandys-tomboy/commits/task-lists2}} is still in a very early phase and has not much functionality yet. At the moment nobody is regularly working on it.

\subsubsection{Others}
Also, there are various inofficial Addins that all have only a very small part of the functionality that we would like to implement. Examples are the \textit{Tomboy-Todo} Addin \footnote{\url{http://romain.blogreen.org/Projects/Tomboy-Todo}} and the \textit{tasklist} Addin\footnote{\url{http://www.ediweissmann.com/taskslist/}}.

\subsubsection{Summary}
\label{lessons}
So, one can say that the main problem (especially of the big \textit{Tasks} project) was, that real Tomboy integration was missing. That means, \textit{Tasks} had new windows for editing and managing the task lists, and was more like a seperate program running \textit{besides} Tomboy, than a Tomboy \textit{Addin}. This is also the reason that a new, separate project \textit{Tasque} was created.
