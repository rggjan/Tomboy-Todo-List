This section contains all software requirements both functional and non-functional.
A requirement has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\bf{Requirement ID}] Uniquely identifies requirement within all TaskList documents.
	\item[\bf{Title}] Gives the requirement a symbolic name.
	\item[\bf{Description}] The definition of the requirement.
	\item[\bf{Priority}] Defines the order in which the requirements should be implemented. Priorities are designated from highest to lowest.
	Possible values are 1 (first to implement), 2 and 3 (last to implement).
	\item[\bf{Risk}] Specifies risk of not implementing this requirement. It shows how the particular requirement is critical to the system.
	there are the following risks levels and associated impact to the system if the requirement is not implemented or implemented incorrectly.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bf Critical (C)}  will break the main functionality of the system. The system can not be used if this requirement is not implemented.
			\item {\bf High (H)} will impact the main functionality of the system. Some function of the system could be inaccessible, but the 
			system can be generally used.
			\item {\bf Medium (M)} will impact some systems features, but not the main functionality. System can be used with some limitation.
			\item {\bf Low (L)} the system can be used without limitation, but with some workarounds.

		\end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Entity Diagram}
    The following diagram shows all defined entities from the requirements above and their relations.
    As we can see a Task is basically modeled as a string and - if its a more complex task - can link to other notes.
    \begin{figure}[h]
    	% TODO remove the grey licensing text in the diagram by using the software with a valid license key

        \caption{TaskList entities and relations}

    This diagram does not define classes that must be implemented in software, but just the common entities

    \label{requirements:interfaces:user}

    \begin{requirement}{Create Task List}
      \desc{The user shall be able to create a new task list with a button or a shortcut text, like ``[]''. These lists expand automatically and contain individual tasks that can be marked as done.}
      \priority{1}
      \riskref{C}
    \end{requirement}

    \begin{requirement}{Edit Task List}
      \desc{The user can add, remove and change single task list items by directly editing the task list in the note itself.}
      \priority{1}
      \riskref{C}
    \end{requirement}

    \begin{requirement}{Priority}
      \desc{The user can optionally add and change priorities to individual tasks and task lists.}
      \priority{1}
      \riskref{H}
    \end{requirement}

    \begin{requirement}{Due date}
      \desc{The user can optionally add and change due dates to individual tasks and task lists, indicating when these should be finished. The system visualizes to the user when items are near or even over their due date.}
      \priority{1}
      \riskref{H}
    \end{requirement}

    \begin{requirement}{Create Subtasks}
      \desc{The user can optionally add subtasks to individual tasks. These subtasks are in principal linked notes, but can themselves contain tasks and task lists.}
      \priority{1}
      \riskref{H}
    \end{requirement}

    \begin{requirement}{Show / hide completed Tasks}
      \desc{The user has various possibilities to handle completed tasks. He can show them crossed out, he can hide them, and he can possibly show them after the completed tasks. }
      \priority{2}
      \riskref{M}
    \end{requirement}

    \begin{requirement}{Reorder Task Lists}
      \desc{The user has the possibility to order the task lists according to various criteria, like due date, priority, date added etc.}
      \priority{2}
      \riskref{L}
    \end{requirement}
