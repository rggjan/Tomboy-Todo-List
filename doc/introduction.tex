\subsection{Purpose}
\label{intro:purpose}
This document specifies the Software Requirements Specification for the TaskManager for Tomboy Project.
It describes scope of the system, both functional and non-functional requirements for the software, system interfaces and existing previous solutions.


\subsection{Scope}
\label{intro:scope}
The project TaskManager is an Addin for Tomboy that will enhance Tomboy with the possibility to do task management. 
The user will be able to create and manage task notes, i.e. adding and removing tasks to task lists and link other task notes in some tasks.
Simple task entries will be enhancable with optional arguments such as due dates and priority.
The user will be able to use Tomboy intuitively as a task management system for daily usage, without prior explanation or documentation. 
The Addin will integrate nicely within the existing concepts and GUI elements of Tomboy.

This is how the final result could look like. Figure \ref{gui} is only a draft, trying to visualize how the integration into Tomboy can be accomplished. You can see a checkbox before each task to mark this particular task as done, along with the corresponding priorities on the left side and due dates on the right side.

The following table defines the list of all documents referenced elsewhere in these requirements.
%TODO Add link to IEEE 830-1998 document
%TODO LÃ¼cke

%TODO: this is in an other section. Is this really a link collection?

\subsection{Overview}
\label{intro:overview}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter \ref{description} defines the general product functions, intended application, constraints to be respected and the assumption made in order to define requirements.
  \item Chapter \ref{requirements} specifies functional (section \ref{requirements:functional}) and non-functional requirements (sections \ref{requirements:nonfunctional_start} to \ref{requirements:nonfunctional_end}), usability, reliability, security, performance and maintainability considerations and requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy these requirements and testers to test that the system satisfies these requirements. %TODO everything mentioned really there?
  \item Chapter \ref{appendix} and Chapter \ref{index} contain index, appendices and supporting information.
\end{itemize}
The document is structured in big parts according to the IEEE 830-1998 standard [IEEE-830].
