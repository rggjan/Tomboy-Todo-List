This section contains all software requirements both functional and non-functional.
A requirement has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\bf{ID}] Uniquely identifies requirement within this requirement document.
	\item[\bf{Title}] Gives the requirement a symbolic name.
	\item[\bf{Description}] The definition of the requirement.
        \item[\bf{Priority}] Defines the order in which the requirements should be implemented. Priorities are designated from highest to lowest. \index{Priority}
	Possible values are 1 (first to implement), 2 and 3 (last to implement).
        \item[\bf{Risk}] Specifies risk of not implementing this requirement. It shows how the particular requirement is critical to the system. \index{Risk}
	there are the following risks levels and associated impact to the system if the requirement is not implemented or implemented incorrectly.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item {\bf Critical (C)}  will break the main functionality of the system. The system can not be used if this requirement is not implemented.
			\item {\bf High (H)} will impact the main functionality of the system. Some function of the system could be inaccessible, but the 
			system can be generally used.
			\item {\bf Medium (M)} will impact some systems features, but not the main functionality. System can be used with some limitation.
			\item {\bf Low (L)} the system can be used without limitation, but with some workarounds.

		\end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
